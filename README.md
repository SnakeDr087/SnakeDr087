👋 Hi, I’m @SnakeDr087
👀 I’m interested in law enforcement innovation, risk management, and using AI-driven tools to enhance organizational performance and public safety.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced AI applications for performance assessment and how they can integrate into public safety solutions.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that bridge technology with public safety, particularly in body-worn camera programs, risk management strategies, and leadership development in public administration.
📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me at jparham@atlasperformancemanagement.com or via LinkedIn: Jonathan Parham.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I’ve led initiatives to integrate martial arts like Jiu-Jitsu into police training, not just for defense but also to reduce excessive force incidents!
